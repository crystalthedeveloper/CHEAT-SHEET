# Install project dependencies based on the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files in a Python project
~$ pipenv install

# Activate the virtual environment using pipenv shell:
# The pipenv shell command doesn't create a new Python interpreter; instead, it activates an existing virtual environment associated with your project. When you # run pipenv shell, it looks for an existing virtual environment in your project (created by pipenv install) and activates it.
~$ pipenv shell

# Install Django:
~$ pipenv install django

# Install Djoser (Token Authentication):
~$ pip install djoser # token


#
# Additional Packages:
#

# Install Django Rest Framework:
~$ pip install djangorestframework

# This package allows your Django REST framework API to support XML as an input and output format in addition to the default JSON.
#xml
~$ pip install djangorestframework-xml
#csv
~$ pipenv install djangorestframework-csv

# Markdown support for the browsable API.
~$ pip install markdown 

# Filtering suppo
~$ pip install django-filter 

# Django to allow requests from your Next.js domain
# Install Django CORS Headers:
~$ pip install django-cors-headers


#
# Additional interpreter:
#

# Once you are inside the virtual environment, you can use Python commands to check information about the Python interpreter and virtual environment. For example:
# To check the Python version:
~$ python --version

Python select interpreter
CTRL+Shift+P

What selected interpreter:
/useer/local/bin/python3

# To check the path to the Python interpreter:
~$ which python

# Create a Virtual Environment with a Specific Python Version:
~$ pipenv --python 3.x

# Update Python in an Existing Virtual Environment:
~$ pipenv update --python 3.x

# Reinstall Packages: After updating Python, you'll likely need to reinstall the packages you were using. This includes packages like django and mysqlclient. You #can reinstall them using pip:
~$ pip install --upgrade django mysqlclient

# Reinstall mysqlclient: Sometimes, reinstalling the mysqlclient package can resolve issues with missing libraries. You can try reinstalling it using pip:
~$ pip install --force-reinstall mysqlclient

# exit pipenv shell
~$ Ctrl + D
